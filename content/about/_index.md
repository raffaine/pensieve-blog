"We have approximately 60,000 thoughts in a day. Unfortunately, 95% of them are thoughts we had the day before."

_The Pensieve_ (Portmanteau formed by Pensive and Sieve, the latter being an object for sorting things) is a magical artifact presented in the stories of Harry Potter by british author J.K. Rowling, it has the ability of storing vivid memories that can later be "re-lived" by anyone with access to the device. 

This was an inspiration to the creation of a tool that attempts to reduce the loss of mental context switching and allows for better organization of ones thoughts allowing even for a very accurate record of ones accumulated knowledge. As it happens in Rowling's Pensieve, another person may access your thoughts, which allows for an unexpected medium for exchange of knowledge and the construction of a unified knowledge base, one that emerges through consensus and not imposition.
