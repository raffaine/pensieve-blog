# Learn your limits
Well, if this can teach me something is that I know almost nothing about current state of web programming. Anyway, time to catch up. Learning some Hugo to get some get going and then will jump into using the Ananke theme with ReactJs to create a minimal JAMStack based app. I'll probably abandon this when creating the tool itself since Hugo accelerates Blog development at a tremendous cost for flexibility on design. ReactStatic seems a better fit for JAMStack as it's mostly focused on the Efficient Single App use case rather than bootstrapping personal blogs or commercial websites (which seems to be the focus of Hugo and other static site generators). Another alternative is Gatsby. It's possible to drop the idea of JAMStack altogether, but I still want to explore more how far I can go with it.

# Storage and the Serverless
Every time I start a new project I immediately start to think on persistence, how will the provided input be stored so that user can retrieve it later. I would want this project to be bold and radical, to use something that would give user more direct control of his own data. I just couldn't think on anything that would meet that criteria. I didn't give up yet, but so far I'm plannning on start on the traditional server-side storage of user's content. One day though, I'm planning to have users storing their Pensieves locally and allow for the application to support both ways, local and remote.

# A world of Graphs
Categorization is a pre-req of the whole thing, if one is not able to categorize his thoughts, he won't be able to later find them or correlate thoughts. For this I'm investing heavily in learning Neo4J, a graph database that has proven its worth and that would allow for very innovative DB usage. I later plan to create a Consensus based Global Category Graph that can be used for people as an "off the shelf" type of category graph (otherwise each user has to build its own).
