# Sounds nice, but why?
The Pensieve is my proposed solution for the issue we constantly face of having to keep too many things in our heads. We are overwhelmed not by our capacity of dealing with the volume of knowledge we have access nowadays but with the inability of effectively switching between the contexts surrounding our ideas. Whenever we switch from thinking about one subject to start another we have to mentally stow away our current mental context and replace it with all knowledge we had so far on the new subject, problem is, that is not a lossless process, we will eventually forget a few details of what we have already learned about the new subject, effect that is even worse if this subject hasn't been brought to our "mental workspace" in a while. This is inneffective, since much of the effort we put into learning or thinking about a subject ends up mostly as duplicated effort.

# How it helps?
I find that one of the most appealing notions on starting a new project is to keep it as simple as possible. This can be summarized by the Minimum Viable Product idea that Eric Ries presents in his book "A Lean Startup", where the goal is to envision what is the minimum set of features a project has to contain to enable it. For the Pensieve, I can see three main things:

* Thoughts: This represent what you are working/reading/doing right now, what summaries you provide, links that are useful and even evidence of your understanding of the topic (certificates, repositories).
* Categories: Every thought is associated with a category, something that groups that thought with others.
  * Category Linking: There are 2 types of linkage, the hard and the soft one, hard link is a directional link that defines a subcategory of a parent category (direction from parent to child). Soft link is a reference or mention, as when I state that my Thought is currently in Ecology and Statistics, which suggests that these two Categories have a link between them but not one that portrails ownership (and therefore non-directional).
* Workspace: This is your current Thought, your working area. At first, only one thought will be available here, but the intent is to allow for thoughts to be linked and form bigger entities.
